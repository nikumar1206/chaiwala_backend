### Chaiwala Backend

##### TODO

- check why some userid is pgtype vs int32
- moved routes likely have extra json field requirements that should now come from path
- add json validations
    - lets just use the go playground validator lib
- wipe old refresh token
- copy models from db and clean up the json serialization
- handle db errors better on key constraints should honestly make that default
- logging
    - customized logger âœ…
    - need to actually add the logs
- make all list endpoints paginated
  - add offset and page_size to query params
- find way to remove passwordDigestoffset
- remove brew time as a database thingy
    - will eventually need to a db migration
- keep ingredients list, call it required ingredients or something as just list[str], nothing in DB for now
- add tea types
- im actually not a big fan of these logging. for the context key. lets remove and just make them constants elsewhere
```go

type TeaType int

const (
	Black TeaType = iota
	Green
	White
	Oolong
	PuErh
	Yellow
	Herbal
	Rooibos
	YerbaMate
	Matcha
	Chai
	Flavored
	Blooming
)
```
- implement recipe steps
- auto refresh on frontend
- revoke refresh on Backend
