##### TODO

- check why some userid is pgtype vs int32
- moved routes likely have extra json field requirements that should now come from path
- add json validations
    - lets just use the go playground validator lib
- wipe old refresh token
- copy models from db and clean up the json serialization
- handle db errors better on key constraints should honestly make that default
- logging
    - customized logger âœ…
    - need to actually add the logs
- make all list endpoints paginated
  - add offset and page_size to query params
- find way to remove passwordDigestoffset
